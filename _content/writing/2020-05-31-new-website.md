Welcome to my new website!  COVID has put an end to a lot of things I was looking forward to, but it also gave me enough downtime to design a completely new website, and for that I am thankful.

I'm also looking forward to writing a lot more during the rest of the summer.  I haven't really written anything in quite a while, and I've missed it a lot.  This will give me the opportunity and platform to create at least a few well-researched essays and other things that interest me.

I'm not anticipating much of a theme at this point, seeing as how this is my personal website and it's bound to be as varied as I am.  If you've found my site, I hope you enjoy this slice of who I am.
