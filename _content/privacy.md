My philosophy of privacy is very simple - what you read is none of my business.  This is a website where I put stuff I enjoy.  I'm not trying to make money or figure out who you are, and I'm not interested in helping those who do.  So I won't track you while you're on my website.  I don't use analytics or cookies.  If you came here from social media, they know you're here.  If you came here from Google, they know you're here.  But I don't.
