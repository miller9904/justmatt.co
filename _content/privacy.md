My philosophy of privacy is very simple - what you read is none of my business.  This is a website where I put stuff I enjoy.  I'm not trying to make money or figure out who you are, and I'm not interested in helping those who do.  That's why I use analytics that respect your privacy and don't collect any personally-identifiable information.  You can read about how they respect and protect your privacy [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/free-privacy-first-analytics-for-a-better-web/).
